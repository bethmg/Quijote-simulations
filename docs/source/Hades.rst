HADES
*****

The `HADES simulations <https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io/hades.html>`__ were the precursor of Quijote, and they contained around 1,000 N-body and hydrodynamic simulations run with different neutrino masses. HADES was designed to study neutrino effects of cosmological observables, while Quijote philosophy is more generic and not just focused on neutrinos.

Quijote now contains all HADES data. The data is however stored on tape, but can be retrieved back and placed in globus, url, and binder. If you need this please reach out to villaescusa.francisco@gmail.com
