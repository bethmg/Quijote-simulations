**October 2023:** Quijote now contains FoF halo catalogs that include the IDs of the particles belonging to the different halos. Check :ref:`halo_catalogues` for details.

**September 2023:** Data from the Ulagam simulations is made publicly available. Check `the Ulagam website <https://ulagam-simulations.readthedocs.io>`_ for details.

**July 2023:** We release Gigantes: the largest collection of detailed void catalog created to-date. Check the `Gigantes website <https://gigantes.readthedocs.io>`_ for details.
 
**July 2023:** We have run Rockstar on the Quijote snapshots and all the halo catalogs are publicly available. The rockstar catalogs are located in the New York cluster. Check :ref:`data_access` for details.

**June 2023:** We have created a series of tutorial to facilitate the usage of Quijote data. Check out :ref:`tutorials` for details. 

**June 2023:** We release Quijote-ODD, a collection of 1,000 N-body simulations with parity-violation initial conditions. We also make publicly available the FoF and Rockstar halo catalogs generated from these simulations. Check :ref:`odd` for more details.

**March 2023:** All data located in the Princeton cluster has been moved to the New York cluster. This means that all Quijote data is now accessible through binder. The Quijote snapshots have also being compressed by Lehman Garrison.

**February 2023:** We are moving all data located in Princeton to the cluster in New York. You may find some files temporarily missing. We are also compressing all Quijote snapshots due to storage limitations. You can still read the data with Pylians3, but if you are using hdf5 you need to use the hdf5plugin module to deal with the compression. See :ref:`snapshots` for more details.

**December 2022:** We have created 3D matter overdensity grids for all PNG simulations and made them publicly available. Data can be accessed through Globus and binder.

**October 2022:** All the halo catalogs of the primordial non-Gaussianities simulations are now publicly available. Check :ref:`png` for more details.

**September 2022:** All Quijote data located in the San Diego and New York clusters (almost 800 Terabytes) can now be accessed via Binder, a system that allows reading and manipulating the data without having to download it. Check :ref:`data_access` for further details.
	  
**July 2022:** The snapshots of Quijote-PNG are now publicly available. Check :ref:`png` for more details.
  
**June 2022:** The nwLH latin-hypercube, containing 2,000 simulations varying :math:`\Omega_{\rm m}`, :math:`\Omega_{\rm b}`, :math:`h`, :math:`n_s`, :math:`\sigma_8`, :math:`M_\nu`, :math:`w` is now publicly available! Check :ref:`LH` for more details.
