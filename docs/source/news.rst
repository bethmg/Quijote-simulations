**December 2022:** We have created 3D matter overdensity grids for all PNG simulations and made them publicly available. Data can be accessed through Globus and binder.

**October 2022:** All the halo catalogues of the primordial non-Gaussianities simulations are now publicly available. Check :ref:`png` for more details.

**September 2022:** All Quijote data located in the San Diego and New York clusters (almost 800 Terabytes) can now be accessed via Binder, a system that allows reading and manipulating the data without having to download it. Check :ref:`data_access` for further details.
	  
**July 2022:** The snapshots of Quijote-PNG are now publicly available. Check :ref:`png` for more details.
  

**June 2022:** The nwLH latin-hypercube, containing 2,000 simulations varying :math:`\Omega_{\rm m}`, :math:`\Omega_{\rm b}`, :math:`h`, :math:`n_s`, :math:`\sigma_8`, :math:`M_\nu`, :math:`w` is now publicly available! Check :ref:`LH` for more details.
