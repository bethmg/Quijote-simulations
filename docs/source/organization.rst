*****************
Data Organization
*****************

The Quijote data is organized into different folders:

- **Snapshots**. This folder contains the snapshots of the simulations
- **Halos**. This folder contains the halo catalogues (both FoF and Rockstar)
- **Voids**. This folder contains the void catalogues
- **Linear_Pk**. This folder contains the linear power spectra of each cosmological model
- **Pk**. This folder contains the non-linear power spectra
- **Marked_Pk**. This folder contains the marked power spectra
- **Bk**. This folder contains the bispectra 
- **CF**. This folder contains the correlation functions
- **PDF**. This folder contains the pdfs
- **3D_cubes**. This folder contains the 3D density fields

Each of the above folders contain several subfolders, that represent the different cosmological models, e.g. ``h_p``, ``fiducial``, and ``Om_m``. See :ref:`types` for a description of the different cosmological models and simulations present in Quijote.
